- 👋 Hi, I’m @SkoogJacob
- 👀 I’m interested in Software engineering, maths etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, Software Design, other object oriented languages
- 💞️ I’m currently a bit swamped with university studies, but I would love to help on something small in Java/Kotlin/C(++) (in that order)
